* The project provides guidance on configuring various settings, such as adjusting the Gemma model's temperature, top_p, and top_k for optimal performance.
* The user interface is designed with gradio, ensuring an intuitive and user-friendly experience.
* For each response, you can access the retrieved content along with the option to view the corresponding PDF.
